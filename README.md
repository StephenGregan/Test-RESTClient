This program comsumes a REST API from a C# Windows Form Application and display the JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) payload.  This application calls a 
RESTful API from the C# applcation.  By doing this I wanted to consume the resources that the API provides.  To achieve this
a RESTful web service is needed.  In the Windows Form there is a textBox called (txtRequestUrl) which is used to paste the url
of the created web service. The textbox (txtResponse)  displays what is returned from the web service.  If everything
is set up correctly clicking the button (Go) will make the REST request and return a JSON response.

Tools used to validate/format json:
